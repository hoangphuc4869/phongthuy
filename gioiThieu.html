              <p>
                In the 1930s, Master David Goh’s grandfather, Feng Shui
                Grandmaster Fu Tian Long (伏天龙大师) inherited the art of
                Imperial Feng Shui from Feng Shui Masters around Southeast Asia
                and Taiwan. His Feng Shui practice spanned an impressive 50
                years, having advised countless clients over the decades. In
                1980, this title was passed down to his son, Feng Shui Master
                Long De Ren (龙德仁师傅), who continued to serve exclusive pools
                of clientele, consulting them in their homes and offices.
                <br /><br />
                From a young age, Master David took a keen interest in his
                father’s practice of Feng Shui and Bazi readings. Having grown
                up with a deep respect for centuries-old Chinese culture, Master
                David also holds a great appreciation for the power of Feng Shui
                in helping others. With the exclusive Feng Shui knowledge and
                experience imparted to him by the Feng Shui Masters before him,
                Master David formed the foundation of his authentic approach to
                Feng Shui. Upon graduation from university, Master David
                answered his life’s calling and took over the reins of the Feng
                Shui practice, founding Imperial Harvest.
                <br /><br />
                In the years since, Imperial Harvest has assisted thousands of
                clients in achieving breakthroughs, rapidly growing to serve a
                prestigious and international pool of clients. Today, Imperial
                Harvest continues its commitment to Feng Shui expertise,
                authentic traditions, and exceptional product quality from its
                luxurious flagship gallery located at Delfi Orchard
